# Database-for-job-portal-management-system

The purpose of designing the online job portal is to provide candidates, ability to register to this application and search for jobs, manage their accounts.

Each candidate will have an account with their own home page.
Employers get to publish the jobs for their company to candidates, can register to the job portal and get their own account created and can post jobs to portalâ€™s database.
Registered employers can add or remove jobs and these jobs can be seen by various candidates and they can contact the concerned person for the job.
